# Sound Interference
## Arduino
1. Check the sample rate
2. figure out how to fix that and make sure the ultrasound device work all the time.
## Low-pass Filter
1. Try analog first
2. Mathematical filter later.
## High-pass filter for the pickup
Try to add the high pass-filter (DC filter) right after the pick up.
Also, start from the unit gain for the second one.
